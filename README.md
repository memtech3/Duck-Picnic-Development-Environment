# Duck Picnic Development Environment
Development environment for the Duck Picnic Grav theme. This repository contains an up to date and configured Grav CMS environment for development with sample content to test features of the theme. This repository does not contain the Duck Picnic theme. In order to make use of this environment, clone the Duck Picnic repository and create a symlink of the Duck Picnic folder in the /user/themes/ folder. PHP -S localhost:PORT_NUMBER system/router.php is my preferred development server. Windows users might find laragon easier to use.
